# TornBlackJackTest
I am testing whether torn.com online game blackjack is beatable using a simulation.

With the current program simulation it looks like it is beatable.

It appears that many of the game's top players are profitable and one has made a claim about the game's flaws below:

## Torn's Black jack rules:

Insurance:  
    Bet 5 dollars, if dealer has a natural win 10 dollars  
    tells us instantly if we won the insurance bet  
Split:  
    Seems you can double down on the second split and higher only  
    Also seems like we can see the dealer's cards on the second hand and up  
        tested when first hand busts
