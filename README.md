# TornBlackJackTest
I am testing whether torn.com online game blackjack is beatable using a simulation.

With the current program simulation it looks like it is beatable. There are a few glitches and it was very hacky and inefficient code.

Black jack rules:

......Insurance:

......Bet 5 dollars, if dealer has a natural win 10 dollars

.........tells us instantly if we won the insurance bet


Split:
	Seems you can double down on the second split and higher only
	Also seems like we can see the dealer's cards on the second hand and up
		tested when first hand busts


#TODO
* Fix the markdown
* Host images elsewhere
* Test all the edge cases in the game's blackjack game
* Take in input to the black jack system, probably start small with just hand charts
* Consider using a hash map to store all the possible hand vals. 
* Auto generate the optimal strategy


# For Torn Players who may have discovered this repo:
If you don't understand what's going on here carry on ;) If you do understand I absolutely don't mind you seeing/using what's considering I put it up on GitHub. I'd appreciate it if this wasn't too widely distributed though! xD (I'm sure if it word gets out Chedburn will remove Blackjack from the casino haha!)
