todo:

make a blacklist store locally
implement the below conditions on the badge and notifications:
    Conditions for a number to appear on the notification:
        Number is number of targets that have been online in the past 10 minutes

    Conditions for a notification to be sent out:
        The target's last action was greater than x but now it's 0 minutes
            this doesn't work without some other condition cuz then it'll happen 30 times a minute while the target is online
                need to store last status, if last status is > 10 min and new status is 


done:
figure out how to make request every x seconds
    setInterval(function, period_in_ms)
